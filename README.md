# CyberSecurity_thread_Analysis
This project aims to analyse a cybersecurity dataset to understand better the types of attacks, the frequency of occurrences, targets, and the effectiveness of preventative measures. The analysis will help detect cyber-attack patterns, assess their damage, and evaluate how well different cybersecurity protocols have mitigated these threats.

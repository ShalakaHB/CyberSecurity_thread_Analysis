# CyberSecurity_thread_Analysis
This project aims to analyse a cybersecurity dataset to understand better the types of attacks, the frequency of occurrences, targets, and the effectiveness of preventative measures. The analysis will help detect cyber-attack patterns, assess their damage, and evaluate how well different cybersecurity protocols have mitigated these threats.
## Objective 
### 1. Distribution of Attack Types:
- Objective:- Categorize and analyze the distribution of various attacks (e.g. DDoS, phishing, malware) to understand which are most reventable.
- Approach:- Group the attack types from the dataset and visualize the distribution to identify the most common types.
  
### 2. Attack Frequency (Time Series Analysis):
- Objective:- Perform a time series analysis on the occurence of attacks to reveal trends, spikes, and periods with higher attack frequency.
- Approach:- Use the timestamp data to create a time series and observe the frequency and trends of attacks over time, identifying peak periods.

### 3. Target Analysis (Region and Organization):
- Objective:- Analyze the geo-location and user information to determine which regions, organizations, or industries are the most trageted.
- Approach:- Use geographic and organisational information to break down attacks by location and industry, helping to identify hight-risk areas.

### 4. Damage Assess:
- Objective:-
